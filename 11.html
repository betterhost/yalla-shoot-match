<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<big>Football fans who aspire to catch all live coverage of UEFA
Champions League matches, often by spending sleepless nights, are aware
of a Ukrainian football team Dynamo Kiev, which hails from Kiev the
capital city of the country. There aren't many who are aware of the
remarkable history of the club , and what happened to its players
following their win in a game convincingly against German Army Football
Team when Nazis attacked the country during the Second World War.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These were the early days of Dynamo Kiev (Before Nazi Invasion)<br />
<br />
This Kiev founded club was established in 1927. It was initially an
amateur team as a part of Dinamo, a nation-wide Soviet Sports Society
and later it was officially funded and supported through NKVD which was
an official Soviet Secret Agency. In the 1930's, Ukraine was terribly
affected under the leadership of Stalin since he was always concerned
about a possibility of Ukrainian breaking away of the Soviet Union
Empire. This is why a lot of attention was given to suppress any
nationalist movements that could have resulted in the deaths of
thousands and millions of citizens of Ukraine miserable. Each and every
city was controlled by the Soviet police, known as the Secret Police
and they would investigate every move made by any citizen from a
suspect viewpoint. The innocent citizens were rounded up sometimes
deported, and then executed by them for making mistakes just as easy as
being late at work , or talking to the foreigners or for quarrelling
with their neighbors etc. Even Ukrainian government officials and
police personnel were not spared this hellish crime. Furthermore,
Stalin's brutal Farming policy shattered the Ukrainian economy and
resulted in a great famine for where 14 million Ukrainens lost their
lives. A sense of fear of terror, hatred, and resentment loomed in
those days, and there was no any hope for the Ukrainians.<br />

</big><big>Football was like a breath of fresh air during the days of
uncertainty and anxieties. At the time, Football was extremely popular
as a sporting activity in all over Soviet Union and it was easy for
anyone to reserve a soccer match ticket and to be engrossed in the
thrilling moments of the game and to be awed by every minute. For them,
it was a moment of relief from a very stressful and stressful
environment and the constant fear of deportation or execution. The most
popular clubs in the Soviet Union were Dynamo Moscow and Spartak
Moscow, two clubs that were based in Moscow and also in the field of
Football, Ukrainians had something to cheer about : the achievements
from Dynamo Kiev. The fiercely contested games played against Dynamo
Kiev and those two clubs from Moscow were followed by a large number of
supporters and often they defeated the Moscow Clubs to take the Soviet
Championship and also to break the Moscow Dominance in the field of
football. The games held with Dynamo Kiev were not just simple games,
but also included National Pride. This club is often regarded as
unofficial Ukrainian National Team by the Ukrainian Government. The
team was sponsored by the government. They participated in the very
first "Soviet Championship" which took place in 1936. The team came
second after battling with all the tough adversaries. In 1937 and 1938,
they won the championship in the top 3 and 4 position respectively. In
1938 campaign, they scored a record 76 goals which is an impressive
feat considering the hardship they suffered and the gruelling
conditions they were forced to endure. They did not achieve their full
potential over the following two seasons (1939 and 1940) and also in
the following season (1941) they were playing well as a unit till the
4th game but following that, the Nazi army invaded the whole Soviet
Union on 22nd June, 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.yalla-shoot-match.com/">يلا شوت</a><br />

Dynamo Kiev during Nazi Invasion<br />
<br />
When the Soviet Union's Red Army lost in the conflict with Nazis
certain Dynamo Kiev players registered themselves in the army and were
sent on the battlefield to fight for their nation and to save their
homeland from foreign invasion. After 3 months of horrible bloodshed,
finally Nazis took full control over the city of Kiev. The Dynamo
players who joined the army were arrested and labelled "Prisoner of
War" and sent to the Prison Camps. The Prison Camps were deficient in
food and water and all prisoners were forced to live in a short
enclosure earmarked by barbed wire fences. After Kiev fell to the
Germans in 1939, the city was witness to the most horrific scene of
devastation along with destruction and death for one year (which
included the execution of 33,771 Jewish men, women and children in just
2 days on 29th and 30th September and by the end of 1941 over 100000
Ukrainians suffered death by shooting at by Nazi army or succumbed to
starvation). But some of Dynamo Kiev players were fortunate to be freed
from prison camps, and they came back to the Kiev city in search of
work. The Dynamo story began on an optimistic note.<br />

Bakery Number 3<br />
<br />
Iosif Kordik, a die-hard supporter of Dynamo Kiev, was the manager of
the huge Bakery Number 3, in Kiev when Nikolai Trusevich, the tall
goalkeeper of the team , came home to Kiev for work and the bakery
offered him a sweeper' s job in the bakery. In those days, people who
were released from prison camps , were not granted a permit for work or
the right to reside within an apartment. This is why offering a work to
Nikolai was illegal but Iosif the manager was thinking of some other
idea in mind. The enthusiastic soccer fan dreamed of creating a strong
Bakery Football Team and gave the responsibility of finding quality
footballers as well as his old teammates over to Nikolai. The always
enthusiastic goalie started his hunt for former teammates by walking
through the streets of Kiev and then slowly one by one, he was able to
find nine of his former Dynamo Kiev teammates (they were Nikolai
Korotkykh, Mikhail Svyridovskiy, Mykola Korotkykh, Oleksiy Kilimenko,
Fedir Tyutchev, Mikhail Putistin, Ivan Kuzmenko, Makar Goncharenko,
Makar Honcharenko) and as well as some of the players of Lokomotiv Kiev
(Vladimir Balakin, Vasil Sukharev, and Mikhail Melnyk). In the
following months, during the days of uncertainty, all team members were
gradually moved to the Bakery 3, where they were provided with vital
food, shelter as well as jobs. Then the players who worked inside the
cafeteria, many who were suffering from malnutrition, started to train
though they were exhausted from their 24- hour work. They began to
believe they had the potential to be an extremely powerful team. The
tall and skilled goalie Nikolai has given their team an official name
"Football Club Start (F.C Start)" as participation in football and
getting job, shelter in the Bakery Number 3 allowed them to live a
different life previously defined mostly by fear, terror and
uncertainty.<br />

<big><br />
<br />
The Journey to F.C Start<br />
<br />
They played their first game in the local league coached by Georgi
Shvetsov who was former professional footballer and sports trainer. The
first opponents of Start were Rukh Shvetsov's personal team. They won
the game by a margin of 7-2 though they haven't got appropriate
footwear, as well as football shirts. Shvetsov became extremely upset
and turned to the German authority and asked them to ban F.C Start from
training at Rukh's Stadium. In the absence of training facilities they
won all matches by huge margins.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They beat the Hungarian Garrison by 6-2 on 21st June 1942. Then they
beat the Romanian Garrison by a huge advantage of 11-1 on 5th July. The
win boosted the morale of all the Ukrainians who felt low in morals and
disappointed over the events that had afflicted them. They would show
up in large numbers, to watch their favourite team mercilessly crushing
the other teams coming from the elite regiments of power.<br />
<br />
<br />
</big><br />
<big><br />
Their winning streak continued , as they again won by a margin of 9-1.
The military railroad workers' team on the 12th and 17th July, they
also defeated PSG (a German unit) by an obscene 6-0. However, slowly
the German authorities began to become irritated by the dominance of
Ukrainians in soccer. They could also observe the enthusiasm that the
team's football players generated within the mass of people and they
sensed that this enthusiasm could pose serious danger to the
foundations of German dominance. This excitement could trigger an
instant freedom movement. On 19th July FC Start won against MSG.Wal
which was a Hungarian team, by a margin of 5-1. They beat MSG.Wal in a
rematch on the 21st July with a slim margin of 3-1. To avoid the
excitement for FC Start in the football field in the first place, the
German Authorities formed a team dubbed Flakelf within the same
division and the players on the team were physically superior to the
players of any other team. When FC Start was playing their last match
against MSG Wal, the Flakelf team was playing Rukh (against the team
from which FC Start started their incredible journey) and Flakelf
almost demolished Rukh and there was speculation that the Flakelf team
was not losing any matches before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So on 6th August, 1942, FC Start met Flakelf in the football field . To
the delight of the German Officials, FC Start won the match
convincingly by a huge margin of 5-1. Now the German Authorities took
the matter seriously and they scheduled a second match between the two
teams on the Sunday of 9th August at Zenith Stadium. The posters were
erected on these walls in order to promote the match between the two
teams.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then: the Game of Death<br />
<br />
On Sunday, August 9th, fans gathered in large numbers to the Zenith
Stadium to watch the match between the newly revived FC Start and the
yet unbeaten Flakelf soccer team. The atmosphere was very much
tension-filled and it required an immense effort by both the Ukrainian
and German police to manage the massive crowd. As the match was about
to begin when the referee for the game, a SS officer arrived at FC
Start's clubhouse and told them to salute the German team in the same
manner as they do with a salute, and saying "Heil Hitler". The FC Start
footballers already sensed that the person who was referring the match
would be biased towards them. When the referee left the area of the
dressing room, there was an exuberant atmosphere. They clearly
understood that the authorities had planned in such a way that if
somehow they managed to win the game, they'll face dire consequences.
Some of them thought of taking the game off the table, and some players
suggested playing a decisive game. One Romanian representative also
visited the locker room and congratulated them for their achievements
to the top of the league. He also offered them a wish for success.
Then, all players unanimously decided to go out on the field to play
football.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yalla-shoot-match.com/"> yallashoot</a><br />
<br />
</big><br />
<br />
<big><br />
Just minutes before the kick-off the strong and stout Flakelf team
gathered at the half-line, and they gave a Nazi Salute "Heil Hitler".
Then it was the turn of the Start players, and they chose not to
perform the Nazi Salute and instead of doing so, they lowered their
arms back to chest and shouted a Soviet slogan called 'FizcultHura!'
that translates to "Physical culture hooray!". The chant received a
intense response from everyone in the vicinity of the stadium. This
angered the German Authorities to a greater extent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as it was thought the ref completely ignored any foul made by the
Flakelf team, and they targeted Start goalie Nikolai to assault
physically. After sustaining blow after blow at the start of the game,
a Flakelf forward smashed Nikolai in the head leaving Nikolai almost
unconscious. While he was recuperating of the injury Flakelf scored
ahead 1-0. The Flakelf team was pulling the jerseys, playing
dangerously, and as they tackled they were targeting players instead of
ball but these tackles were not able to get any attention from the
official. Despite these facts, FC Start scored a amazing equalizer on
an open kick from the winger, Kuzmenko. This goal was met with a huge
applause from the crowd of fans who were previously screaming abuse at
the Flakelf team over their poor performance. After the equalizer
Goncharenko another Start forward, dribbling through the vicious
Flakelf defence , scored another stunning goal. They went ahead. In the
final minutes of interval, they scored a goal, and the scoreline read
3-1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At halftime, the team was thrilled to have overpower the tough
challenges faced by them in the match and the scoreline was also in
their favour. Yet, Shvetsov, a former football player, suddenly
appeared to the locker room and told them to protect themselves from
being beaten by their opponents. Soon after he left another SS officer
arrived and told them that although they're a good team but they must
lose the game otherwise they will get harsh penalty at the hands of the
Authority.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Amidst the confusion and in a state of indecisiveness the Start players
began with the second part of the match and this time it was it was
Flakelf team, fearing a crowd disturbance they played with less force.
Start as well as Flakelf each scored two goals and Start was ahead at
the time 5-3. After that, Klimenko, a Start player, landed the ball in
the midfield, and he fought off the entire German defense and walked
towards the penalty box. In the end, instead of moving the ball towards
the an goalline, the player turned and kicked the ball back towards the
centre circle. It was a complete humiliation for the Flakelf team,
since the defender had the option not to score against them. Soon after
that the official blew his final whistle.</big><br />
