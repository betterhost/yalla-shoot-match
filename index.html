<br />
<br />
<br />
<big>In many countries, the names of the game sound alike. The words
football, fussball and futbol... They don't only sound alike, they're
the exact identical game. It is a sport in the U.S., however, they call
it soccer. Major League Soccer (MLS) as an American professional soccer
league has been in existence for a while now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contrary to other American major league sports MLS doesn't dominate
attention of the public on a international scale, nor do the champion
is named the "World Champion". MLS is in an ever-changing process of
development. Did it attract notable media and public interest in the
world football? No!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soccer as the 2nd, 7th , or 10th most popular sports in the U.S.
doesn't make a huge difference. American public will still follow the
NFL, MLB, NHL or NBA. The world's population will follow those leagues
with identical attention because they are the world's most popular
sports leagues.<br />
In recent times, with the advent of global media, the world's sporting
scene has begun to change; in that way, English football, the Premier
League claims to be 'The greatest Show On Earth' and is actually the
most watched and most watched sporting league, with a current
world-wide audience that is half-a-billion and media revenues for
seasons 2007 to 2010 worth over $5 billion. If everyone around the
world is watching football leagues like English Premiership or Spanish
La Liga which is the case, who will watch the American major leagues
outside of the American public? Is it likely that a significant portion
of the American population choose to watch soccer leagues in other
countries as well? This is the reason soccer has become an issue in the
U.S sports.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img style="width: 640px; height: 424px;" alt="soccer" src="images/1.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Every now and then, it happens that MLS officials would awaken from
their sleep under the shadows of the top 4 American premier leagues
around the time the World Cup takes places and it would become apparent
how significant the football game is in the terms of world public
interest media attention, sponsors, and sponsors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As the noise around World Cup passes, the MLS would slip back into
sleepiness. It wasn't to be similar to that following 2006's World Cup
2006 in Germany when the world public had an accurate picture of
European the modern football stadiums, multi-million dollar player
deals... and the global spotlight took the spotlight on football.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This time , it's not MLS who should promote MLS, it's the whole of
American professionally-run sports entertainment. This is an economic
opportunity that will generate a lot of money. the world of football
was too great to be missed or neglected.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.yalla-shoot-match.com/">yallashoot</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
in the spring of 2007, U.S. soccer attempted to be the first to take
the world of soccer by storm by offering David Beckham a $250million
contract which was the most expensive football player contract ever in
the history of the sport. Many have claimed it was the deal that
brought Beckham in America is believed to be the most significant in
the history of sports. MLS sent out a message across the planet.<br />
In the summer heat as European leagues were between the seasons and the
water was still, MLS got the wanted media attention, as news stories
were heavily focused on the Beckham family's move to LA. Did the
stories outshine the world's football media and the public's attention
to MLS yet? No!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are the $250 million worth of exposure in the long run? Time will tell.
Autumn came, European and international leagues are fully in play, and
the world's sports media publish smaller pieces on Beckham, LA Galaxy
and the MLS. And to make matters worse, LA will not even make it to the
play-offs. This gives the media less than a few stories to report on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the league that has been able to lose around $350 million over the
first 8 years after its foundation (a BusinessWeek report from 2004) in
which at moment, the only teams in existence, LA Galaxy and FC Dallas
are making money, with three more teams expected to be profitable
within a year. A $250,000 single-player investment is a gamble. If it
is, what are the chances?<br />
In recent years, several notable players chose to make the decision to
leave the top teams of Europe and South America for a financially
lucrative contract with teams from the Gulf countries. There was a lot
of coverage about the lucrative transfer deals, though there was not a
lot of information about those leagues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to be forgotten, before David Beckham's arrival, MLS attempted to
gain exposure with Freddy Adu, a player under the age of 16 who was
chosen as"The Next" Pel e. Adu received significant media attention,
the world knew he's playing in the MLS club DC United of the MLS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many may or may not know that Adu during the summer of 2012, at 18
years old, signed a contract to play in Europe with Benfica FC -
Portugal. Prior to signing with Benfica, Adu spent some time in Man
Utd's training camp, Alex Fergusson did not give Adu the reason why he
should stay.<br />
Benfica has paid the club from Salt Lake City $2million for the release
form for the player and Adu will be receiving $1.2million per year,
which is solid but not the deal that is the best announcement. Adu
wasn't on Benfica's Champions League match roster against Milan on
September. 18th. In comparison, to a player similar to Messi at his
current age was in the starting 11 for the giant football club FC
Barcelona. The MLS didn't appear to have gained substantial attention
for the sport due to Adu, nor contributed to his growth into a top
player in the world, as one would expect. Through the years, many great
players of all time played soccer in the United States and the United
States, such as Pel E, Beckenbauer, Eusebio...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After decades of attempts that didn't yield the desired results for the
success in U.S. soccer, what changes Beckham's play (currently in a
six-week absence due to injury) can make in the near future? Let's
glance at the MLS which is a professional soccer league that started in
1996 and has more than decade of playing experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.yalla-shoot-match.com/">يلا شوت</a><br />

At the time of publishing this texton September 27, 2007 Beckham's LA
Galaxy is playing against the KC Wizards. SPORTiana.com is the writer
of this article, got the knowledge of MLS by KC Wizards in the summer
of 2006, which was a time before Beckham's entry as a player in MLS. At
that time the head coach of KC Wizard was unhappy with having him as
well as two assistant coaches running the team's training, forcing him
to take a number of players from the 26-man roster waiting on the bench
because of the inability to bring them all onto the field during
trainings simultaneously.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The training facilities included one open-air and an in-door field that
was used for gym for team NFL team KC Chiefs, within the Arrowhead
Stadium complex. The Wizard's open-air training field was situated
right next to the fence that was situated in front of KC Chiefs
training fields.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The grass that was on the Wizards field was split into with the turf on
the ground being that was as solid as a stone, a field where many
players would not train in order to avoid injuries. A head coach, two
assist coaches, Fitness trainer... NFL stadium and facilities... small
office space on the corner of a football stadium... the place is quite
different with the teams that were in leagues where Beckham previously
played.<br />
